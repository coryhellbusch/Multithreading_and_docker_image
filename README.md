Hotel Booking App

This hotel booking app allows a user to view the features of the hotel and book a room. Once a room is booked it is no longer available. The user provides a date range for the booking. 

Technologies used:
Backend:

This was a project for one of my college classes, in which I was provided both the Angular front-end and the Java back-end.
I added multi-threading to create a welcome message in two languages, and I put the app into a docker file to prepare it to run on Azure.
